# Server

## Architecture

The architecture of the server is layered:

### Infrastructure (Delivery & 3rd party services)

HTTP, SSH, Stripe...


### API

GraphQL, GitHTTP...

In the `api` folder.

### Application services

The is where our business logic lives.

They are in the `domain/[xxx]/service` folders.


### Repositories

This is our abstraction over data storage and access.

They are in the `domain/[xxx]/repository` folders.


## Folders

`driver`: contains interfaces and implementations for external services like email and caching

`api`: contains the implementation of the differents apis (graphql...)

`app`: contains the logic to have the other components running as a program

`db`: contains interfaces and implementation to interact with a database

`domain`: contains all the data structures and interfaces to modelize the domain, organized byt its bounded contextes.

`errors`: contains the error types of the application

`http`: contains the implementation of the http delivery layer -->
